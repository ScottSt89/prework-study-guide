# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- This project is a study guide for new students of the Coding Bootcamp beginning on October 3rd, 2022 in which I wanted to help others who are starting out who may not have done a single line of code or even tried to get into the art of web development, but would love to be taught the craft!
- This guide helps new students to the class on what to study, what is important to study, and what they can expect in the Coding Bootcamp class.
- I learned a great deal about the basic concepts of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript and the functions they provide to web developers. I also learned what to expect in real world situations and/or the Coding Bootcamp starting shortly. Not only did I learn the basic concepts of the core programs, but also learned about time management, organization, the art of debugging, overall mindset with myself and my processes mentally, and strategies used by web development teams to get any project done as a group and as an individual.

## Usage

This study guide can be used to see basic notes from topics discussed in the prework such as HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It will help to have an idea of what is covered in the Bootcamp and what may be best to learn first, prior to the beginning of the Bootcamp class. If we open the DevTools console on Google Chrome by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windowns), and selecting the "Console" section, we can see that JavaScript is running. It will also list the topics we learned from the prework and help choose a topic to study first.
